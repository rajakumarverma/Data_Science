**Statistics** is the branch of mathematics that deals with **collecting, organizing, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data**. It helps us make sense of large amounts of information and draw conclusions or make decisions based on that data.

### Two Main Types of Statistics:

1. **Descriptive Statistics:**

   * Summarizes or describes the main features of a data set.
   * Examples: mean, median, mode, standard deviation, charts, and graphs.

2. **Inferential Statistics:**

   * Uses a sample of data to make predictions or generalizations about a larger population.
   * Involves probability, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing.
