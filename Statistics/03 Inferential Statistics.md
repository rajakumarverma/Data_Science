| 1.  | Hypothesis Testing Basics             | A method to make decisions using data. We test an assumption (hypothesis) about a population.                                       | - Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ): No effect<br> - Alternative Hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ): There is an effect | You think your red toy car is faster than the blue one. You test both cars to see if the red one really is faster or if it's just luck.                                       |                   |                                                                                                                               |
| 2.  | P-value in Hypothesis Testing         | Probability that your observed results are due to chance. Helps decide whether to reject H‚ÇÄ.                                        | If p < Œ± (0.05), reject H‚ÇÄ                                                              | You toss a coin 10 times and get 9 heads. You ask, ‚ÄúIs the coin unfair?‚Äù If the chance of this happening randomly is really low (p < 0.05), you say the coin might be unfair. |                   |                                                                                                                               |
| 3.  | Z-test in Hypothesis Testing          | Used to test whether a sample mean is significantly different from a known population mean when population std. deviation is known. | Z = (XÃÑ - Œº) / (œÉ / ‚àön)                                                                 | If candy packs normally have 10 candies, and your pack has 12, you check if that‚Äôs a big difference using a Z-test.                                                           |                   |                                                                                                                               |
| 4.  | Student‚Äôs t-Distribution              | A probability distribution used when the sample size is small and population std. deviation is unknown.                             | t-distribution table (varies with degrees of freedom)                                   | You only have 5 candy packs and don‚Äôt know how many candies usually come in each. You use the t-distribution to check if your pack is special.                                |                   |                                                                                                                               |
| 5.  | T-Test and T-Statistics               | Used to compare means when œÉ is unknown or n is small. Types: one-sample, two-sample, paired.                                       | t = (XÃÑ - Œº) / (s / ‚àön)                                                                 | You try cookies from two brands and give scores. You use a t-test to check if one brand is really better, or if it's just your guess.                                         |                   |                                                                                                                               |
| 6.  | Z-Test vs T-Test                      | Both test means, but use different conditions. Z-test is for large n and known œÉ. T-test is for small n or unknown œÉ.               | ‚Äî                                                                                       | Z-test: when you ask everyone in your class. T-test: when you only ask a few friends and don't know the true average.                                                         |                   |                                                                                                                               |
| 7.  | Type I and Type II Errors             | Mistakes in hypothesis testing:<br> - Type I: Rejecting a true H‚ÇÄ<br> - Type II: Not rejecting a false H‚ÇÄ                           | ‚Äî                                                                                       | Type I: You say your toy is broken, but it's not.<br>Type II: Your toy is broken, but you think it's fine.                                                                    |                   |                                                                                                                               |
| 8.  | Bayes‚Äô Theorem                        | A formula that updates the probability of an event based on new evidence.                                                           | P(A                                                                                     | B) = \[P(B                                                                                                                                                                    | A) √ó P(A)] / P(B) | You think it might rain. Then you see dark clouds. Bayes‚Äô helps you say: ‚ÄúNow it‚Äôs more likely to rain because I see clouds.‚Äù |
| 9.  | Confidence Interval & Margin of Error | An interval estimate around a sample mean that likely contains the true population mean.                                            | CI = XÃÑ ¬± Z \* (œÉ / ‚àön)                                                                 | You say: ‚ÄúI think I have 10 candies, but maybe between 8 and 12.‚Äù That range is your confidence interval.                                                                     |                   |                                                                                                                               |
| 10. | Chi-Square Test                       | Tests if categorical variables are related, or if observed frequencies differ from expected ones.                                   | œá¬≤ = Œ£ (O - E)¬≤ / E                                                                     | You expect each face of a dice to come up the same number of times. If 6 shows more than others, the chi-square test checks if the dice is fair.                              |                   |                                                                                                                               |
| 11. | Chi-Square Goodness of Fit            | A specific chi-square test that checks how well observed data fit a theoretical distribution.                                       | Same as above                                                                           | You expect your toy colors to be equal: red, blue, green. You check if the counts match your expectations.                                                                    |                   |                                                                                                                               |
| 12. | What is ANOVA                         | ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) checks if 3 or more groups have different means.                                                       | F = Between Group Var. / Within Group Var.                                              | You try 3 types of juice and score them. ANOVA checks if any type is rated significantly better than the others.                                                              |                   |                                                                                                                               |
| 13. | Assumptions of ANOVA                  | ANOVA works under these:<br>1. Normality<br>2. Equal variance<br>3. Independent samples                                             | ‚Äî                                                                                       | Everyone in your group should drink the juice fairly (no cheating), and your scoring should be honest and not influenced by others.                                           |                   |                                                                                                                               |
| 14. | Types of ANOVA                        | - **One-way ANOVA**: One factor (e.g., type of toy)<br> - **Two-way ANOVA**: Two factors (e.g., toy type and color)                 | ‚Äî                                                                                       | One-way: You test different toy cars.<br>Two-way: You test cars of different brands *and* colors.                                                                             |                   |                                                                                                                               |
| 15. | Partitioning in ANOVA                 | Breaking total variance into:<br>1. Between groups (explained)<br>2.
